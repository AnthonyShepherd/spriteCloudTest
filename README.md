# spriteCloudTest

How to Run the Tests Locally

Web: 
  - Install Selenium AddOn for whichever Browser you use.
  - Download SpriteCloudTest.side from this repository and Import it into the Add On. 
  - Run the tests

API: 
  - Download Postman
  - Download Petstore Test Automation.postman_collection from this repository
  - Import the Collection Into Postman and Run Collection



Run Tests in CI/CD Pipeline
(Ran out of time for this) 
  - Would use either GitLab or Jenkings (I would need to use Newman with Postman in order to automate the collection) 
  - Not sure how I would go about adding the Capture and Playback to a Jenkings Pipeline, would need to go research that one.

Scenario Selection:

[Risk based Approach - each software I asked a few questions to help me determine risk, I had to make a few assumptions but was happy with the selection]
